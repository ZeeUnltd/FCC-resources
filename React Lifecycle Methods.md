React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount
React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:

```javascript
componentWillMount()

componentDidMount()

componentWillReceiveProps()

shouldComponentUpdate()

componentWillUpdate()

componentDidUpdate()

componentWillUnmount()

```
The next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.


The componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.

```javascript
 class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  componentWillMount() {
    // change code below this line
    console.log('Hello, how are you?')
    // change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return <div />
  }
};
```

React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount
Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount(). This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.


There is a mock API call in componentDidMount(). It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. This example requests the current total active users for a site. In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1. Watch what happens in the preview, and feel free to change the timeout to see the different effects.

**Answer**

```javascript
 class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      activeUsers: null
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout( () => {
      this.setState({
        activeUsers: 1273
      });
    }, 2500);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Active Users: { this.state.activeUsers }</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

React: Add Event Listeners
The componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.


Attach an event listener in the componentDidMount() method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback handleKeyPress(). You can use document.addEventListener() which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.

Then, in componentWillUnmount(), remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to document.removeEventListener(). It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.

**Answer**

```javascript
 class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: ''
    };
    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);
    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);
  }
  // change code below this line
  componentDidMount() {
    document.addEventListener('keydown',  this.handleKeyPress)
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', this.handleKeyPress)
  }
  // change code above this line
  handleEnter() {
    this.setState({
      message: this.state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '
    });
  }
  handleKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
      this.handleEnter();
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

**Question**

React: Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods
Another lifecycle method is componentWillReceiveProps() which is called whenever a component is receiving new props. This method receives the new props as an argument, which is usually written as nextProps. You can use this argument and compare with this.props and perform actions before the component updates. For example, you may call setState() locally before the update is processed.

Another method is componentDidUpdate(), and is called immediately after a component re-renders. Note that rendering and mounting are considered different things in the component lifecycle. When a page first loads, all components are mounted and this is where methods like componentWillMount() and componentDidMount() are called. After this, as state changes, components re-render themselves. The next challenge covers this in more detail.


The child component Dialog receives message props from its parent, the Controller component. Write the componentWillReceiveProps() method in the Dialog component and have it log this.props and nextProps to the console. You'll need to pass nextProps as an argument to this method and although it's possible to name it anything, name it nextProps here.

Next, add componentDidUpdate() in the Dialog component, and log a statement that says the component has updated. This method works similar to componentWillUpdate(), which is provided for you. Now click the button to change the message and watch your browser console. The order of the console statements show the order the methods are called.

Note: You'll need to write the lifecycle methods as normal functions and not as arrow functions to pass the tests (there is also no advantage to writing lifecycle methods as arrow functions).

**Answer**

```javascript
  class Dialog extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  componentWillUpdate() {
    console.log('Component is about to update...');
  }
  // change code below this line
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    console.log(this.props)
    console.log(nextProps)
  }
  componentDidUpdate () {
    console.log('Component has updated')
  }
  // change code above this line
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1>
  }
};

class Controller extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: 'First Message'
    };
    this.changeMessage = this.changeMessage.bind(this);
  }
  changeMessage() {
    this.setState({
      message: 'Second Message'
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.changeMessage}>Update</button>
        <Dialog message={this.state.message}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

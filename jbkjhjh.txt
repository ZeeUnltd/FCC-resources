Idea

##1
Google Diary
Write an electron App that can save posts/articles/read-ups with a title/description and the Url attached.
a search should be implemented and can filter from the title/description to fetch the exact solution
- the title/description can be displayed as a .md file, so that code snippets can be easily readable from the get go.

- A category list can be created or added from a list, and each post can be tagged to a category or more, one-to-many/many-to-many

React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount
React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:

```javascript
componentWillMount()

componentDidMount()

componentWillReceiveProps()

shouldComponentUpdate()

componentWillUpdate()

componentDidUpdate()

componentWillUnmount()

```
The next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.


The `componentWillMount()` method is called before the `render()` method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within ``componentWillMount()`` - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.

**Answer**

```javascript
 class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  componentWillMount() {
    // change code below this line
    console.log('Hello, how are you?')
    // change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return <div />
  }
};
```

React: Use the Lifecycle Method `componentDidMount`
Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method `componentDidMount()`. This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to ``setState()`` here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.


There is a mock API call in `componentDidMount()`. It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. This example requests the current total active users for a site. In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1. Watch what happens in the preview, and feel free to change the timeout to see the different effects.

**Answer**

```javascript
 class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      activeUsers: null
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout( () => {
      this.setState({
        activeUsers: 1273
      });
    }, 2500);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Active Users: { this.state.activeUsers }</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```


**Question**

React: Add Event Listeners
The `componentDidMount()` method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as `onClick()`. React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.


Attach an event listener in the `componentDidMount()` method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback `handleKeyPress()`. You can use `document.addEventListener()` which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.

Then, in `componentWillUnmount()`, remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to `document.removeEventListener()`. It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.

**Answer**

```javascript
 class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: ''
    };
    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);
    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);
  }
  // change code below this line
  componentDidMount() {
    document.addEventListener('keydown',  this.handleKeyPress)
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', this.handleKeyPress)
  }
  // change code above this line
  handleEnter() {
    this.setState({
      message: this.state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '
    });
  }
  handleKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
      this.handleEnter();
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

**Question**

React: Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods
Another lifecycle method is `componentWillReceiveProps()` which is called whenever a component is receiving new props. This method receives the new props as an argument, which is usually written as `nextProps`. You can use this argument and compare with this.props and perform actions before the component updates. For example, you may call `setState()` locally before the update is processed.

Another method is `componentDidUpdate()`, and is called immediately after a component re-renders. Note that rendering and mounting are considered different things in the component lifecycle. When a page first loads, all components are mounted and this is where methods like componentWillMount() and `componentDidMount()` are called. After this, as state changes, components re-render themselves. The next challenge covers this in more detail.


The child component Dialog receives message props from its parent, the Controller component. Write the `componentWillReceiveProps()` method in the Dialog component and have it log this.props and `nextProps` to the console. You'll need to pass `nextProps` as an argument to this method and although it's possible to name it anything, name it `nextProps` here.

Next, add `componentDidUpdate()` in the Dialog component, and log a statement that says the component has updated. This method works similar to `componentWillUpdate()`, which is provided for you. Now click the button to change the message and watch your browser console. The order of the console statements show the order the methods are called.

Note: You'll need to write the lifecycle methods as normal functions and not as arrow functions to pass the tests (there is also no advantage to writing lifecycle methods as arrow functions).

**Answer**

```javascript
  class Dialog extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  componentWillUpdate() {
    console.log('Component is about to update...');
  }
  // change code below this line
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    console.log(this.props)
    console.log(nextProps)
  }
  componentDidUpdate () {
    console.log('Component has updated')
  }
  // change code above this line
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1>
  }
};

class Controller extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: 'First Message'
    };
    this.changeMessage = this.changeMessage.bind(this);
  }
  changeMessage() {
    this.setState({
      message: 'Second Message'
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.changeMessage}>Update</button>
        <Dialog message={this.state.message}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

**Question**

React: Optimize Re-Renders with `shouldComponentUpdate`
So far, if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is `shouldComponentUpdate()`, and it takes `nextProps` and `nextState` as parameters.

This method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props haven't changed. You can use `shouldComponentUpdate()` to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (this.props) to the next props (nextProps) to determine if you need to update or not, and return true or false accordingly.


The `shouldComponentUpdate()` method is added in a component called OnlyEvens. Currently, this method returns true so OnlyEvens re-renders every time it receives new props. Modify the method so OnlyEvens updates only if the value of its new props is even. Click the Add button and watch the order of events in your browser's console as the other lifecycle hooks are triggered.

**Answer**

```javascript
    class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log('Should I update?');
     // change code below this line
     if(nextProps.value % 2 < 1){
      return true;
     }
     // change code above this line
  }
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    console.log('Receiving new props...');
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('Component re-rendered.');
  }
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.value}</h1>
  }
};

class Controller extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 0
    };
    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);
  }
  addValue() {
    this.setState({
      value: this.state.value + 1
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.addValue}>Add</button>
        <OnlyEvens value={this.state.value}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

**Question**

React: Add Inline Styles in React
You may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the style attribute set to a JavaScript object. First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with fontSize instead of font-size. Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.

All property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like {fontSize: "4em"}. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.


If you have a large set of styles, you can assign a style object to a constant to keep your code organized. Uncomment the styles constant and declare an object with three style properties and their values. Give the div a color of "purple", a font-size of 40, and a border of "2px solid purple". Then set the style attribute equal to the styles constant.

**Answer**

```javascript

 const styles = {
   color: 'purple',
   fontSize: 40,
   border: '2px solid purple'
 }
// change code above this line
class Colorful extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // change code below this line
    return (
      <div style={styles}>Style Me!</div>
    );
    // change code above this line
  }
};

```

**Question**

React: Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method
In previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.

You can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.


In the code provided, the render method has an array that contains 20 phrases to represent the answers found in the classic 1980's Magic Eight Ball toy. The button click event is bound to the ask method, so each time the button is clicked a random number will be generated and stored as the randomIndex in state. On line 52, delete the string "change me!" and reassign the answer const so your code randomly accesses a different index of the possibleAnswers array each time the component updates. Finally, insert the answer const inside the p tags.

**Answer**

```javascript
  const inputStyle = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
}

class MagicEightBall extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      userInput: '',
      randomIndex: ''
    }
    this.ask = this.ask.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  ask() {
    if (this.state.userInput) {
      this.setState({
        randomIndex: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
        userInput: ''
      });
    }
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      userInput: event.target.value
    });
  }
  render() {
    const possibleAnswers = [
      'It is certain',
      'It is decidedly so',
      'Without a doubt', 
      'Yes, definitely',
      'You may rely on it',
      'As I see it, yes',
      'Outlook good',
      'Yes',
      'Signs point to yes',
      'Reply hazy try again',
      'Ask again later',
      'Better not tell you now',
      'Cannot predict now',
      'Concentrate and ask again',
      'Don\'t count on it', 
      'My reply is no',
      'My sources say no',
      'Most likely',
      'Outlook not so good',
      'Very doubtful'
    ];
    const answer = possibleAnswers[this.state.randomIndex]; 
    
    // wrong
    // possibleAnswers[Math.floor(Math.random() * possibleAnswers.length)];
//     Array.prototype.randomElement = function () {
//     return this[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.length)]
// } 
// OR
// const answer = possibleAnswers[this.state.randomIndex];
// << change code here
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={this.state.userInput}
